Perfect! This project highlights your **practical upgrade** from a DuckDuckGo-based chatbot to a **smarter, cleaner, and more stable real-time search agent using Tavily**, which is a fantastic improvement to showcase in your portfolio.

Here’s a **longer, more thoughtful `README.md`** that emphasizes usefulness, your thought process, and what you actually learned while building it:

# 🔍 AI Web Assistant with LangChain + Tavily + Groq

This project is an **improved web search chatbot** built using:

- 🧠 [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)
- ⚡ [Groq’s LLaMA3-70B](https://groq.com/)
- 🔎 [Tavily Search](https://www.tavily.com/)
- 📚 Wikipedia + Arxiv Research Access
- 🧵 [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for real-time chat UI

> ✅ **Project Name:** Improved Search with Tavily

## 🚀 Why I Built This

After building a working chatbot using DuckDuckGo and Groq LLM, I started noticing **rate limits**, **irrelevant results**, and the lack of **structured citations**.  
To solve this, I explored **Tavily Search API**, which gives rich and focused web results, and integrated it with **LangChain tools**.

This new version:
- Is **cleaner**, more **reliable**, and **faster**
- Leverages **Wikipedia**, **Arxiv**, and **Tavily** to cover both casual + academic search use cases
- Supports **real-time web browsing** with controlled tool execution

## ✨ Highlights

- 🔎 Web-wide semantic search via **Tavily**
- 📚 Research-backed results from **Arxiv + Wikipedia**
- 🤖 Large-scale inference with **Groq LLaMA3-70B**
- 🧠 Smart LangChain **AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION** logic
- ⚙️ API-key protected & safe for live deployments
- 💬 Simple & fast **chat interface using Streamlit**

```

### 3️⃣ Install All Dependencies

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# or
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Create a `.env` File

## 🧠 How It Works

1. You enter a query like *"What is the latest in generative AI?"*
2. The LangChain agent determines which tools to use (Tavily, Wiki, or Arxiv)
3. Each tool is used only **once per query** for efficiency
4. Groq’s LLM synthesizes the gathered context and gives a final answer
5. You get a precise, structured, and human-readable response.

## 🎓 About Me

I'm currently an **MCA final-year student**, working on mastering AI tooling and GenAI systems.
This project was a breakthrough moment — it was the first time I realized how **agents can reason**, **choose tools**, and **retrieve real-time knowledge** without needing fine-tuning.

I'm actively working on building 20+ such projects covering:

* 🔍 Real-world Search Agents
* 🧠 RAG Applications
* ⚙️ MLOps Deployment
* 🤖 LLM-powered Tools

📌 Open to roles in: AI Engineering • RAG Systems • Search • LangChain + MLOps

## 🧭 Future Upgrades

* 🧠 Add memory for session-aware conversations
* 📑 Attach citations and links for transparency
* 🛡️ Add rate-limiting handling for Tavily
* 🌍 Deploy to Hugging Face Spaces or GCP Cloud Run
